# LLM
Large language Models (LLM). Browse the <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/">Wolfram directory</a> and associated URLs (directory and content pages), to create the category structure and good word embeddings. The goal is to generate enriched prompts for GPT, Wikipedia, ArXiv, Google Scholar, Stack Exchange or Google search. The focus is on one subdiretory: Probability & Statistics. 
<p>
Documentation is in my project textbook <code>Projects4.pdf</code>, <a href="https://github.com/VincentGranville/Large-Language-Models/blob/main/Projects4.pdf">here</a> in this folder. I strongly encourage you to download the document and browse your local copy with Chrome, Edge, or other viewers. Unlike on the GitHub, you will be able to click on all the links and follow the internal navigation features.
