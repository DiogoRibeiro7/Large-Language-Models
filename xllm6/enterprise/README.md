The doc for <code>xllm-enterprise-v2.py</code> is in xllm-enterprise-v2.pdf. The previous version (xllm-enterprise.py) is no longer maintained. I also created a library <code>xllm_enterprise_util.py</code>. Both <code>xllm-enterprise-v2-user.py</code> and <code>xllm-enterprise-dev.py</code> use that library. The former is essentially the same as xllm-enterprise-v2.py but much shorter since all the functions have been moved to the library. The latter also uses the same algorithms and architecture with recent additions (relevancy scores) but it serves a different purpose: testing a large number of prompts.
