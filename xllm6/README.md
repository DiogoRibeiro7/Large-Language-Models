xLLM6 is still under development. But a stable version is now availble in this folder, for one sub-LLM, with Python code and back-end tables. The differences with xLLM5 are explained in section C.4 (appendix), in the project textbook, <a href="https://github.com/VincentGranville/Large-Language-Models/blob/main/Projects4.pdf">here</a>. Downloas the textbook to make all clickable links active, instead of just viewing it on GitHuv. 

One main difference with xLLM5 is the introduction of x-embeddings, consisting of multu-token words.
