xLLM6 is still under development. But a stable version is now availble in this folder, for one sub-LLM, with Python code and back-end tables. The differences with xLLM5 are explained in section C.4 (appendix), in the project textbook, <a href="https://github.com/VincentGranville/Large-Language-Models/blob/main/Projects4.pdf">here</a>. Download the PDF textbook and view it on a standard browser to activate all the clickable links and cross-references. 

One main difference with xLLM5 is the introduction of x-embeddings, consisting of multi-token words. No other LLM has this unique feature, as far as I know.
